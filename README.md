Timato helps increasing productivity monitoring your work and rest time based on the famous ["Pomodoro" technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
This was my first macOS app and my first time programming in Swift, so please go easy on me 😂. The developing of Timato was perfect for knowing how Apple applications are programmed through Xcode editor, in particular the StoryBoard that always had my attention.
